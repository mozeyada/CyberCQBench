**ALERT CLASSIFICATION**: {category}
**INCIDENT TYPE**: {scenario_type.title()}
**SEVERITY LEVEL**: High Priority
**DETECTION TIMESTAMP**: 2024-01-15 14:30:00 UTC
**INVESTIGATION STATUS**: Active - Requires Immediate Analysis
**ASSIGNED ANALYST**: SOC Tier 2 Analyst
**ESCALATION REQUIRED**: Yes - Management Notification Pending

**PRIMARY TECHNICAL QUESTION**:
{short_prompt}

**ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT AND ENVIRONMENT**:
- **Infrastructure**: Enterprise hybrid cloud environment spanning AWS, Azure, and on-premises data centers
- **Affected Systems**: Production web servers, database clusters, user workstations, and network infrastructure devices
- **Business Impact Assessment**: Potential service disruption affecting customer-facing applications and internal business operations
- **Compliance Framework**: Organization operates under SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001:2013, and industry-specific regulatory requirements
- **Data Classification**: Systems contain PII, financial records, intellectual property, and regulated healthcare information

**DETAILED INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS**:

1. **Immediate Response Actions**:
   - Execute containment procedures to prevent lateral movement and additional system compromise
   - Implement network segmentation and traffic isolation for affected systems and network segments
   - Preserve digital evidence following established forensic procedures and chain of custody protocols
   - Document all investigative steps and findings for audit trail and legal requirements

2. **Technical Analysis Framework**:
   - Conduct comprehensive log analysis across SIEM, endpoint detection, network monitoring, and application security tools
   - Perform threat hunting activities to identify additional indicators of compromise and affected systems
   - Analyze attack vectors, tactics, techniques, and procedures using MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping
   - Assess data exposure risks and potential exfiltration activities through network traffic analysis

3. **Business Impact and Risk Assessment**:
   - Evaluate operational disruption to critical business processes and customer service delivery
   - Assess financial implications including direct costs, regulatory fines, and reputational damage
   - Review compliance obligations and regulatory notification requirements under applicable frameworks
   - Coordinate with legal, privacy, and executive teams for stakeholder communication planning

4. **Recovery and Remediation Planning**:
   - Develop system restoration procedures ensuring clean recovery from known good backups
   - Implement additional security controls and monitoring to prevent similar incidents
   - Plan phased service restoration with appropriate testing and validation procedures
   - Schedule post-incident review and lessons learned documentation for process improvement

**COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS**:
- **Data Protection**: GDPR Article 33 breach notification requirements (72-hour timeline)
- **Industry Standards**: PCI DSS incident response procedures for payment card data
- **Regulatory Bodies**: Notification requirements for financial services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure sectors
- **Legal Obligations**: Evidence preservation, litigation hold procedures, and law enforcement coordination

**DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS**:
Provide comprehensive incident analysis including threat classification, detailed technical assessment of the attack methodology, business impact evaluation, immediate containment strategy recommendations, step-by-step investigation procedures, evidence collection and preservation protocols, and specific regulatory compliance recommendations with timeline requirements for notifications and remediation activities."""
